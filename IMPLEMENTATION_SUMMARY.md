### Key Components

#### 1. Streaming Module (`streaming.py`)
- **StreamMessage**: Data class for messages with JSON serialization
- **StreamHandler**: Message handler registration and processing
- **BiDirectionalStream**: Core streaming with send/receive queues
- **WebSocketStream**: WebSocket-based streaming extension

#### 2. Executor Module (`executor.py`)
- **PythonExecutor**: Basic subprocess-based execution
- **SafePythonExecutor**: Enhanced with safety pattern blocking
- **ExecutionResult**: Standardized result format
- Timeout support and async execution

#### 3. Mock Services Module (`mock_services.py`)
- **MockGoogleCloudServices**: All mock AI services
- Sentiment analysis with heuristic-based scoring
- Translation with mock output
- Text generation with random responses
- Speech services (STT/TTS) mocked
- Request history tracking

#### 4. Server Module (`server.py`)
- **ADKServer**: Combined HTTP and WebSocket server
- REST API endpoints for all services
- WebSocket handler for streaming
- Health check and monitoring
- Configurable components

#### 5. Mobile Module (`mobile/android_webview.py`)
- **AndroidWebViewBridge**: Bridge interface
- JavaScript code generation
- HTML template with UI
- Android integration examples

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- **21 unit tests** covering all core functionality
- **100% pass rate** for all tests
- Test categories:
  - Streaming tests (7 tests)
  - Executor tests (7 tests)
  - Mock services tests (7 tests)

### Manual Verification
- ✅ All example scripts executed successfully
- ✅ Server startup and endpoint testing
- ✅ WebSocket connectivity verified
- ✅ WebView HTML template validated
- ✅ Python execution tested with various code
- ✅ Mock services tested with all operations

### Security Analysis
- ✅ CodeQL analysis completed: **0 vulnerabilities found**
- ✅ Code review completed with fixes applied
- ✅ No security warnings from static analysis

## Example Applications

Six complete example applications provided:

1. **basic_streaming.py**: Demonstrates core streaming functionality
2. **python_execution.py**: Shows code execution with safety checks
3. **mock_services_demo.py**: Tests all mock AI services
4. **run_server.py**: Starts complete server
5. **test_server_endpoints.py**: HTTP endpoint integration tests
6. **websocket_client.py**: WebSocket client example

## Documentation

### Comprehensive Documentation Provided
1. **README.md**: Quick start, installation, API reference
2. **USAGE_GUIDE.md**: Detailed usage with code examples
3. **LICENSE**: MIT License
4. **Code comments**: Inline documentation throughout

### Topics Covered
- Installation instructions
- Core concepts and architecture
- API documentation for all endpoints
- Code examples for all features
- Android integration guide
- Best practices and troubleshooting

## Performance Characteristics

### Scalability
- Async/await throughout for non-blocking operations
- Multiple concurrent streams supported
- Efficient message queuing
- No blocking operations in main paths

### Resource Usage
- Lightweight subprocess execution
- Minimal memory footprint for streaming
- Configurable timeouts prevent hanging
- Request history management provided

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- ✅ Basic pattern blocking in SafePythonExecutor
- ✅ Timeout protection for code execution
- ✅ Input validation on API endpoints
- ✅ No SQL injection vectors (no database)
- ✅ No command injection (subprocess uses file execution)

### Future Enhancements Noted
- Docker sandboxing for code execution (documented)
- Authentication/authorization system
- Rate limiting
- Enhanced input sanitization
- CORS configuration for production

## Deployment

### Installation Methods
1. From source: `pip install -e .`

### Running the Server
```bash
# Simple start
python examples/run_server.py

# Custom configuration
python -c "from adk_mcp.server import ADKServer; ADKServer(port=9000).run()"
```

### Endpoints Available
- `GET /`: Information page
- `GET /health`: Health check
- `GET /webview`: Android WebView interface
- `POST /execute`: Python code execution
- `POST /api/sentiment`: Sentiment analysis
- `POST /api/translate`: Text translation
- `POST /api/generate`: Text generation
- `ws://host:8081`: WebSocket streaming

## Known Limitations

1. **Python Execution**: Simple subprocess-based (Docker sandboxing planned)
2. **Voice Support**: Not implemented (text-only by design)
3. **Real Cloud Services**: All mocked (integration planned)
4. **iOS Support**: Not implemented (Android only currently)
5. **Authentication**: Not implemented (noted for production)

All limitations are by design per requirements or explicitly documented for future enhancement.

## Future Roadmap
