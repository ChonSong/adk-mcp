# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for enhancing the existing ADK-MCP (Agent Development Kit - Model Context Protocol) server to support real-time, bidirectional voice communication with Google ADK-Web integration. The system will enable users to have natural voice conversations with an AI agent that can execute Python code and provide real-time responses.

## Glossary

- **ADK-MCP Server**: The main server application providing Agent Development Kit functionality with Model Context Protocol support
- **Google ADK-Web**: Google's Agent Development Kit for web-based AI interactions with voice capabilities
- **Bidirectional Streaming**: Real-time, two-way audio communication allowing interruptions and natural conversation flow
- **Live API**: Google's real-time voice API supporting streaming speech-to-text and text-to-speech
- **WebSocket Connection**: Persistent connection for real-time audio streaming between client and server
- **Audio Worklet**: Browser API for low-latency audio processing
- **Code Execution Tool**: Server-side capability to execute Python code safely
- **Session Context**: Maintained conversation state across multiple voice interactions

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to have voice conversations with an AI agent, so that I can interact naturally without typing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Start Audio", THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL establish a WebSocket connection for audio streaming
2. WHILE the microphone is active, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL continuously process incoming audio chunks
3. WHEN audio is received, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL convert speech to text using Google Live API
4. WHEN the user speaks, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL generate appropriate AI responses using gemini-2.5-pro
5. WHEN generating responses, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL convert text to speech and stream audio back to the client

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interrupt the AI agent while it's speaking, so that I can have natural conversational flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user speaks during AI response playback, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL immediately stop the current audio output
2. WHEN an interruption occurs, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL process the new user input with priority
3. WHILE processing interruptions, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL maintain conversation context
4. WHEN resuming after interruption, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL acknowledge the interruption appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ask the AI agent to execute Python code through voice commands, so that I can run scripts hands-free.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user requests code execution via voice, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL parse the code execution intent
2. WHEN code execution is requested, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL execute Python code using the Code Execution Tool
3. WHEN code execution completes, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL capture both output and errors
4. WHEN providing results, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL speak the execution results back to the user
5. WHERE code execution fails, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL provide error information via voice response

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use the system in a web browser, so that I can access it from any device with internet connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the web interface, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL serve a responsive web application
2. WHEN the web app loads, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL request microphone permissions from the browser
3. WHILE using the web interface, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL utilize Web Audio API for audio capture
4. WHEN audio is captured, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL stream audio chunks via WebSocket
5. WHEN receiving audio responses, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL play audio through the browser's audio system

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to use the system on Android devices, so that I can have voice interactions on mobile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on Android, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL provide a WebView-based mobile interface
2. WHEN the Android app starts, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL request RECORD_AUDIO permission
3. WHILE using the mobile interface, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL maintain full voice functionality
4. WHEN switching between apps, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL handle audio session management appropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to authenticate with Google Cloud services, so that real AI capabilities are available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL authenticate using Google Cloud service account credentials
2. WHEN authentication succeeds, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL initialize connection to Vertex AI with gemini-2.5-pro model
3. WHEN authentication fails, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL log appropriate error messages and gracefully degrade
4. WHILE operating, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL maintain secure communication with Google Cloud APIs
5. WHERE credentials are invalid, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL provide clear error messages for troubleshooting

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to maintain conversation context across multiple voice interactions, so that I can have coherent multi-turn conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a voice session starts, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL create a new conversation context
2. WHILE the session is active, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL maintain conversation history
3. WHEN processing new voice input, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL include relevant conversation context
4. WHEN the session ends, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL properly clean up conversation resources
5. WHERE session timeout occurs, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL gracefully handle context cleanup

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want Python code execution to be contained, so that malicious code cannot harm the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing Python code, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL run code in a controlled environment
2. WHEN code execution begins, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL apply timeout limits to prevent infinite loops
3. WHILE code is running, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL monitor resource usage
4. WHEN dangerous operations are detected, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL block or sanitize the code
5. WHERE execution fails, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL provide safe error messages without exposing system details

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time audio streaming with low latency, so that conversations feel natural and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN streaming audio, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL maintain latency under 500ms for voice processing
2. WHILE streaming, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL handle audio chunks of appropriate size for real-time processing
3. WHEN network issues occur, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL implement appropriate buffering strategies
4. WHEN audio quality degrades, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL adapt streaming parameters automatically
5. WHERE connection is lost, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL attempt reconnection with session recovery

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN voice interactions occur, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL log session events with appropriate detail levels
2. WHEN errors occur, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL log error details with context for debugging
3. WHILE processing audio, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL monitor performance metrics
4. WHEN system resources are stressed, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL log performance warnings
5. WHERE debugging is needed, THE ADK-MCP Server SHALL provide detailed trace information
